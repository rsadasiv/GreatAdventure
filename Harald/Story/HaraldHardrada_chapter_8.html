<h2>Anglo Saxon Chronicle</h2>
<p class='section-Anglo Saxon Chronicle'>This year came dreadful fore-warnings over the land of the Northumbrians, terrifying the people most woefully: these were immense sheets of light rushing through the air, and whirlwinds, and fiery, dragons flying across the firmament. These tremendous tokens were soon followed by a great famine: and not long after, on the sixth day before the ides of January in the same year, the harrowing inroads of heathen men made lamentable havoc in the church of God in Holy-island, by rapine and slaughter.</p>
<h2>Wikipedia</h2>
<p class='section-Wikipedia'>In 1066 Halley’s Comet was seen, appearing to be four times the size of , and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the . Halley came within 0.10  of Earth at that time</p>
<p class='section-Wikipedia'>Halley's Comet is visible from Earth every 74–79 years.</p>
<h2>Anglo Saxon Chronicle</h2>
<p class='section-Anglo Saxon Chronicle'>Then was over all England such a token seen as no man ever saw before. Some men said that it was the comet-star, which others denominate the long-hair'd star. It appeared first on the eve called "Litania major", that is, on the eighth before the calends off May; and so shone all the week. </p>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>There are two sea routes from Norway to England. The Dane way is south down Jutland, turn east along Friesland and then go straight across the English Channel. Not much wind, but a safe route for cargo ships under oars. The Viking way is south down the coast of Trondheim, straight across the North Sea to a halt at the Shetlands, then Orkneys and follow the coast to Northumbria.</p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>King Harald’s army assembled in Sólundir. And when King Harald was ready to sail out from Niðaróss, then he first went to King Óláfr’s shrine and opened it and cut his hair and nails and afterwards locked the shrine and threw the keys out into the Nið, and the blessed King Óláfr’s shrine has never since been opened. There had now passed from his fall thirty-five winters. He had also lived thirty five winters in this world. King Harald took the troops that were following him south to meet up with his own troops. A large force was collected there, so that it is people’s report that King Harald had nearly two hundred ships, and in addition carriers for provisions and small craft.</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>So when King Harald was ready and there arose a favourable wind, he sailed out to sea and came to land by Hjaltland, though some of his troops came by Orkney. King Harald lay there a short while, before he sailed to Orkney, and he took with him from there a large troop and Jarl Þorfinnr’s sons, the jarls Páll and Erlendr, but left there Queen Ellisif and their daughters Maria and Ingigerðr. From there he sailed south past Scotland and on past England and came to land there where it is called Kliflǫnd. There he went ashore and immediately made raids and subjected the land to himself, meeting no resistance. </p>
<h2>Anglo Saxon Chronicle</h2>
<p class='section-Anglo Saxon Chronicle'>Soon after this came in Earl Tosty from beyond sea into the Isle of Wight, with as large a fleet as he could get. When Tosty understood that King Harold was on the way to Sandwich, he departed thence, and took some of the boatmen with him, willing and unwilling, and went north into the Humber with sixty skips; whence he plundered in Lindsey, and there slew many good men. When the Earls Edwin and Morkar understood that, they came hither, and drove him from the land. And the boatmen forsook him. Then he went to Scotland with twelve smacks; and the king of the Scots entertained him, and aided him with provisions; and he abode there all the summer. There met him Harald, King of Norway, with three hundred ships.</p>
<p class='section-Anglo Saxon Chronicle'>…</p>
<p class='section-Anglo Saxon Chronicle'>Came Tosty the earl into Humber with sixty ships. Edwin the earl came with a land-force and drove him out; and the boatmen forsook him. And he went to Scotland with twelve vessels; and Harald, the King of Norway, met him with three hundred ships, and Tosty submitted to him; and they both went into Humber, until they came to York.</p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>After that King Harald made for Skarðaborg and fought there with the citizens. He went up onto the cliff that is situated there and had a great fire made there and set ablaze. And when the fire was burning, they took great forks and flung the fire down into the town. Then one building after another caught fire. Then the whole place went up in flames. The Norwegians slew many people there, and took all the wealth they got hold of. There was then nothing else the English people could do, if they were to stay alive, but submit to King Harald. He then subjected all the land to himself wherever he went. After that King Harald made his way with the whole army south along the coast and landed by Hellornes. There he was met by an assembled force, and King Harald fought a battle there and was victorious.</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Jarl Valþjófr and the troops that got away fled up to the city of Jork. There was a very great slaughter there. The battle was on Wednesday, the next day before Matheusmass.</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Jarl Tósti had come from the south from Flæmingjaland to King Harald as soon as he got to England, and the jarl was in all these battles. It then turned out as he had said to Harald before this meeting, that multitudes of people thronged to them in England. These were relations and friends of Jarl Tósti, and it was a great enhancement of the king’s forces. After this battle that has just been related, troops from all round the neighbouring districts submitted to King Harald, though some fled. Then King Harald prepared his expedition to capture the city and stationed his army by Stamford Bridge. And because the king had won such a great victory against great leaders and overwhelming forces, all the people were afraid and despaired of standing up to him. Then the citizens decided to send a petition to King Harald and offer themselves and also the city into his power. The result of this whole petition was that on the Sunday King Harald went with his whole army up to the city and set up an assembly, the king and his men, outside the city, and the citizens attended the assembly. All the people accepted submission to King Harald, and gave him hostages, sons of high-ranking men, it being the case that Tósti knew details of all the people in that city, and in the evening the king went down to his ships with an automatic victory, and was very merry. An assembly was arranged for early on the Monday in the city. King Harald was then to set up the organisation of the place with men of the ruling class and hand out ranks and fiefs. </p>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>Everything was going according to plan. What I hadn’t planned for was exactly how much Harold hated Tostig.</p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>On the Monday, when Harald Sigurðarson had eaten breakfast, he had the trumpets blown for going ashore, then he makes his army ready and divides the troops, which parts are to go and which are to be left behind. In every company he had two men go inland for every one left behind. Jarl Tósti got ready for going inland with King Harald with his company, </p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>The weather was now extremely good and the sun was hot. The men left behind their mailcoats, and marched up with shields and helmets and halberds and girded with swords, and many also had arrows and bows and were very merry. But when they advanced into the neighbourhood of the city, they found riding towards them a large troop. They saw the cloud of dust raised by the horses and beneath it fair shields and white mailcoats. Then the king halted his troops, had Jarl Tósti called to him and asked what troops these would be.</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>The jarl speaks, saying he thought it more than likely that it would be hostile, saying also that it could on the other hand turn out that this would be some of his kinsmen, looking for mercy and friendship, so as to get in return the king’s support and trust.</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Then the king said that they would first of all hold still and find out about the army. They did so, and the troop turned out to be larger the closer it got, and to look at it all seemed just like a heap of bits of ice with the glittering of their weapons.</p>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>Instead of hanging around the Isle of Wight waiting for William, he puts his whole army on a forced march for a month, just to kill Tostig. And the Northumbrians hated Tostig so much, they did not give us any warning that the English army was approaching, and in fact they fell in behind the Saxon army as it approached.</p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>After that King Harald drew up his troops, making the battle line long and not deep. Then he curved the wings round backwards so that they met. It then formed a wide circle and a thick one, and the same everywhere all round the outside, shield against shield and the same above their heads, but the king’s company was within the circle and the standard was there too. It was a picked troop. In a separate place was Jarl Tósti with his company. He had a different standard. It was drawn up in this way, because the king knew that mounted men were accustomed to ride forwards in small detachments and withdraw immediately. So the king says that his company and the jarl’s company should move forward to where the greatest need was. “And our bowmen shall also be there with us, and those that are standing foremost shall set the butts of their spears in the ground, and set the points before the breasts of the riders, if they ride at us, and those that are standing closest, they are to set their spear points before the breasts of the horses.”</p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>King Harold of the English spoke to the Norwegians that were with him: “Did you recognise that big man with the dark tunic and the fair helmet?” </p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>“That is the king himself,” they said. </p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>The king of the English says: “A big man and he has a stately air, and it is more than likely that he has run out of luck.”</p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Then spoke one of the horsemen: “Is Jarl Tósti among the troops?” </p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>He answers: “That is not to be denied, you will find him here.” </p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Then spoke one of the horsemen: “Your brother Harold sends you a greeting and has this to say too, that you should have pardon and the whole of Northumberland, and rather than that you should not be willing to pay homage to him, then he will give you a third of the whole kingdom alongside him.” </p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Then answers the jarl: “Then there is something on offer other than hostility and dishonour like last winter. If this had been offered then, then there would be many a man still alive that is now dead, and the kingdom in England would then have been in a better state. Now if I accept this offer, what will he offer King Harald Sigurðarson for his trouble then?” </p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Then spoke the horseman: “He has said something about that, what he will grant him of England: a space seven foot long, or so much longer as he is taller than other men.”</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Then says the jarl: “Go now and tell King Harald that he should prepare for battle.” </p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Then King Harald spoke:</p>
<div class='poetry'>We creep not because of weapons’ crash</div>
<div class='poetry'>The discreet valkyrie ordered</div>
<div class='poetry'>In battle into the shield’s hollow.</div>
<div class='poetry'>To hold my helmet-stump</div>
<div class='poetry'>high the necklace-prop</div>
<div class='poetry'>long ago commanded me, in metal-din</div>
<div class='poetry'>where met skulls and battle-ice.</div>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>King Harald stepped forward in the battle to where the fighting was densest. There was then the most violent of battles, and many troops on both sides fell. Then King Harald got so furious that he leapt forward right out of the formation and struck with both hands. There stood against him then neither helmet not mailcoat. Then all those that were closest took to flight. The English men were then right on the point of fleeing.</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>King Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow. That was his death wound. Then he fell and all the company that had advanced with him, except those that pulled back, and they held the standard. There was then still the harshest of battles. Then Jarl Tósti went beneath the royal standard. Then both sides began to form up a second time, and there was then a very long pause in the battle.</p>
<h2>Anglo Saxon Chronicle</h2>
<p class='section-Anglo Saxon Chronicle'>It was on the eve of St. Matthew the apostle, which was Wednesday. Then after the fight went Harald, King of Norway, and Earl Tosty into York with as many followers as they thought fit; and having procured hostages and provisions from the city, they proceeded to their ships, and proclaimed full friendship, on condition that all would go southward with them, and gain this land.</p>
<p class='section-Anglo Saxon Chronicle'>…</p>
<p class='section-Anglo Saxon Chronicle'>Thither came Harold, king of the English, unawares against them beyond the bridge; and they closed together there, and continued long in the day fighting very severely. There was slain Harald the King of Norway, and Earl Tosty, and a multitude of people with them, both of Normans and English; and the Normans that were left fled from the English, who slew them hotly behind; until some came to their ships, some were drowned, some burned to death, and thus variously destroyed; so that there was little left: and the English gained possession of the field. But there was one of the Norwegians who withstood the English folk, so that they could not pass over the bridge, nor complete the victory. An Englishman aimed at him with a javelin, but it availed nothing. Then came another under the bridge, who pierced him terribly inwards under the coat of mail.</p>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>So that’s where I died. 25 September 1066, on the banks of a muddy Yorkshire stream, with my boats and my bodyguards a full days hard march away at the coast. Over the years several wanna-be cathedrals claimed to have a piece of my corpse as a holy relic, but it wasn’t true. I’m still here.</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>Anglo Saxon Chronicle</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>This year died King Edward, and Harold the earl succeeded to the kingdom, and held it forty weeks and one day. And this year came William, and won England. And in this year Christ-Church [Canterbury] was burned. And this year appeared a comet on the fourteenth before the kalends of May.</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>Tosty went thence, and did harm everywhere by the sea-coast where he could land, as far as Sandwich. Then was it made known to King Harold, who was in London, London, that Tosty his brother was come to Sandwich. Then gathered he so great a ship-force, and also a land force, as no king here in the land had before gathered, because it had been soothly said unto him, that William the earl from Normandy, King Edward's kinsman, would come hither and subdue this land: all as it afterwards happened. When Tosty learned that King Harold was on his way to Sandwich, then went he from Sandwich, and took some of the boatmen with him, some willingly and some unwillingly; and went then north into Humber, and there ravaged in Lindsey, and there slew many good men. When Edwin the earl and Morcar the earl understood that, then came they thither, and drove him out of the land. And he went then to Scotland: and the king of Scots protected him, and assisted him with provisions; and he there abode all the summer. Then came King Harold to Sandwich, and there awaited his fleet, because it was long before it could be gathered together. And when his fleet was gathered together, then went he into the Isle of Wight, and there lay all the summer and the harvest; and a land-force was kept everywhere by the sea, though in the end it was of no benefit. When it was the Nativity of St. Mary, then were the men's provisions gone, and no man could any longer keep them there. Then were the men allowed to go home, and the king rode up, and the ships were dispatched to London; and many perished before they came thither. When the ships had reached home, then came King Harald from Norway, north into Tyne, and unawares, with a very large ship-force, and no small one; that might be, or more. And Tosty the earl came to him with all that he had gotten, all as they had before agreed; and then they went both, with all the fleet, along the Ouse, up towards York.</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>Then was it made known to King Harold in the south, as he was come from on ship-board, that Harald King of Norway and Tosty the earl were landed near York. Then went he northward, day and night, as quickly as he could gather his forces. Then, before that King Harold could come thither, then gathered Edwin the earl and Morcar the earl from their earldom as great a force as they could get together; and they fought against the army, and made great slaughter: and there was much of the English people slain, and drowned, and driven away in flight; and the Northmen had possession of the place of carnage. And this fight was on the vigil of St. Matthew the apostle, and it was Wednesday. And then, after the fight, went Harald, King of Norway, and Tosty the earl, into York, with as much people as seemed meet to them. And they delivered hostages to them from the city, and also assisted them with provisions; and so they went thence to their ships, and they agreed upon a full peace, so that they should all go with him south, and this land subdue. Then, during this, came Harold, king of the Angles, with all his forces, on the Sunday, to Tadcaster, and there drew up his force, and went then on Monday throughout York; and Harald, King of Norway, and Tosty the earl, and their forces, were gone from their ships beyond York to Stanford bridge, because it had been promised them for a certainty, that there, from all the shire, hostages should be brought to meet them. Then came Harold, king of the English, against them, unawares, beyond the bridge, and they there joined battle, and very strenuously, for a long time of the day, continued fighting: and there was Harald, King of Norway, and Tosty the earl slain, and numberless of the people with them, as well of the Northmen as of the English: and the Northmen fled from the English. Then was there one of the Norwegians who withstood the English people, so that they might not pass over the bridge, nor obtain the victory. Then an Englishman aimed at him with a javelin, but availed nothing; and then came another under the bridge, and pierced him terribly inwards under the coat of mail. Then came Harold, king of the English, over the bridge, and his forces onward with him, and there made great slaughter, as well of Norwegians as of Flemings. And the King's son, Edmund, Harold let go home to Norway, with all the ships.</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>Heimskringla</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>After the battle, King Harald’s marshal Styrkárr got away, a splendid person. He got hold of a horse and thus rode away. In the evening some wind arose, rather a cold one, but Styrkárr had no clothing other than a tunic and a helmet on his head and some kind of sword in his hand. He got cold when he recovered from his weariness. Then he was met by a wagoner and he was in a fur-lined coat.</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>Then spoke Styrkárr: “Will you sell the coat, farmer?’ </p>
<p class='section-Harald'>“Not to you,’ he said.  “You must be a Norwegian, I recognise your speech.” </p>
<p class='section-Harald'>Then said Styrkárr: “If I am a Norwegian, what do you want, then?” </p>
<p class='section-Harald'>The farmer answers: “I would like to kill you, but unfortunately I have no usable weapon.” </p>
<p class='section-Harald'>Then said Styrkárr: “If you cannot kill me, farmer, then I shall try whether I can kill you.” </p>
<p class='section-Harald'>He swings up his sword and brings it down on his neck so that his head flew off, after that took the fur-lined coat and leapt on his horse and went down to the shore.</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>Anglo Saxon Chronicle</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>And the while, William the earl landed at Hastings, on St. Michael's-day: and Harold came from the north, and fought against him before all his army had come up: and there he fell, and his two brothers, Girth and Leofwin; and William subdued this land. And he came to Westminster, and Archbishop Aldred consecrated him king, and men paid him tribute, delivered him hostages, and afterwards bought their land.</p>
<h2>Wikipedia</h2>
<p class='section-Wikipedia'>The background to the battle was the death of the childless King  in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death, but faced invasions by William, his own brother , and the Norwegian King  (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the on 20 September 1066, and were in turn defeated by Harold at the  five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at  on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went</p>
<p class='section-Wikipedia'>After defeating his brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada in the north, Harold left much of his forces in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest of his army south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion. It is unclear when Harold learned of William's landing, but it was probably while he was travelling south. Harold stopped in London, and was there for about a week before Hastings, so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south, averaging about 27 mi (43 km) per day, for the approximately 200 mi (320 km). </p>
<p class='section-Wikipedia'>Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke. The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy. Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of  (present-day Battle, East Sussex), about 6 mi (9.7 km) from William's castle at Hastings.</p>
<p class='section-Wikipedia'>The exact numbers present at the battle are unknown as even modern estimates vary considerably. The composition of the forces is clearer: the English army was composed almost entirely of  and had few , whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between  and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect. Therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.</p>
<p class='section-Wikipedia'>There continued to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England. Casualty figures are hard to come by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen.</p>
