<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>King Harald was a powerful man and a firm ruler within his own country, very intelligent in his thinking, so that it is universally held that there has been no ruler in Northern Lands that has been as profoundly wise as Harald or as clever in his decisions. He was a great warrior and of the very boldest in fighting. He was strong and better able to use weapons than any other man, as has been written above.</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>King Harald was a handsome man and noble-looking, fair-haired and with a fair beard and long moustache, one eyebrow a little higher than the other, large hands and feet and both well shaped. His height measured five ells. He was fierce to his enemies and harsh in punishments for any opposition.</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>King Harald was most ambitious for power and for any advantageous possessions. He was hugely liberal towards his friends, those that he was well pleased with.</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>King Harald was fifty years of age when he fell. We have no noteworthy accounts of his youth until he was fifteen winters old, when he was at Stiklarstaðir in the battle along with his brother King Óláfr, and after that he lived thirty-five winters. And all that time he never had any respite from violence and warfare. King Harald never fled from a battle, but he often took precautions in the face of overwhelming odds that he had to deal with. Everyone said, who followed him in battle and warfare, that when he was in a situation of great danger and it had suddenly come upon him, that he would adopt the course that everyone realised afterwards had been the most likely to work.</p>

<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Brynjólfr gamli úlfaldi’s (Camel’s) son Halldórr was an intelligent man and a great leader. He said this, when he heard people’s talk, and people were assessing the characters of the brothers King Óláfr the Saint and Harald quite differently, then Halldórr spoke as follows:</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>“I was on very friendly terms with both the brothers, and I was acquainted with both their characters. I never came across two men more alike in character. They were both most sensible and most bold as fighters, men ambitious for wealth and power, imperious, not in sympathy with ordinary people, natural rulers and stern in punishment. King Óláfr forced the people of the country to Christianity and right conduct, and harshly punished those that turned a deaf ear. The leaders of the land would not put up with his just and fair judgments and rose against him here and killed him on his own territory. As a result he became a saint. But Harald fought for fame and power and forced all the people to submit to him, as far as he could. He also fell on other kings’ territory. Both the brothers were men that were virtuous in general conduct and high-minded. They were widely travelled and men of great energy and from this became widely renowned and famous.”</p>

<p class='section-Heimskringla'>King Magnús ruled over Norway, the son of Harald, the first winter after the fall of King Harald, and after that he ruled two winters with his brother Óláfr. There were then these two kings. Magnús held the more northerly part of the country, and Óláfr the more easterly. King Magnús had a son that was called Hákon. He was fostered by Steigar-Þórir. He was a most promising man.</p>
