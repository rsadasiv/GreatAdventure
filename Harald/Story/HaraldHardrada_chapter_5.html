<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>I escaped from Byzantium and went to see Yaroslav. Yaroslav remained a master bullshitter. He’d been hit in the ankle with an arrow, so he limped, but on the up side he was King of all the Rus and he had a marriageable daughter. I was happy to be alive but sad that there was a fortune in gold that I had left behind. So Yaroslav and I hatched a plan.</p>
<h2>Chronographia</h2>
<p class='section-Chronographia'>Zoe was open-handed, the sort of woman who could exhaust a sea teeming with gold-dust in one day.</p>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>One thing Zoe couldn’t tolerate was not being able to buy anything she wanted. And there were a lot of things she wanted. Periodically, John the Eunuch would convince her husband that he should limit Zoe’s spending in the name of saving the treasury. Now eventually, Zoe’s husbands tended to wind up dead, but Zoe’s immediate response to being denied in this way was to transfer gold from the treasury to the lower vaults of her personal palace in Blachernae.</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>Which is also where we had the barracks of the Varangian Guard.</p>
<h2>Tale of Bygone Years</h2>
<p class='section-Tale of Bygone Years'>Yaroslav sent his son Vladimir to attack Greece, and entrusted him with a large force. He assigned the command to Vyshata, father of Yan. Vladimir set out by ship, arrived at the Danube, and proceeded toward Tsar'grad. A great storm arose which broke up the ships of the Russes; the wind damaged even the Prince's vessel, and Ivan, son of Tvorimir, Yaroslav's general, took the Prince into his boat. The other soldiers of Vladimir to the number of six thousand were cast on shore, and desired to return to Rus', but none of the Prince's retainers went with them. Then Vyshata announced that he would accompany them, and disembarked from his vessel to join them, exclaiming, "If I survive, it will be with the soldiers, and if I perish, it will be with the Prince's retainers." They thus set out to return to Rus'. It now became known to the Greeks how the Russes had suffered from the storm, and the Emperor, who was called Monomakh, sent fourteen ships to pursue them. When Vladimir and his retainers perceived that the Greeks were pursuing them, he wheeled about, dispersed the Greek ships, and returned to Rus' on his ships. But the Greeks captured Vyshata, in company with those who had been cast on land, and brought them to Tsar'grad, where they blinded many of the captive Russes.</p>
<h2>Chronographia</h2>
<p class='section-Chronographia'>Having escaped detection, they had already got inside the Propontis when they made their first proposals for peace, conditional on the payment of an enormous sum for reparations. They mentioned the actual amount, a thousand staters for each ship, on the understanding that this money should be counted out to them in one way only — on one of the ships in their own fleet. Such were the proposals they put forward, either because they imagined that there were springs of gold in our domains, or simply because they had decided to fight in any case. The terms were impossible, purposely so, in order that they could have a plausible excuse for going to war. So, as their envoys were not even considered worthy of an answer, both sides prepared for combat. The enemy were so confident in their own overwhelming numbers that they thought the city, with all its inhabitants, would surrender. </p>
<p class='section-Chronographia'>At the time our naval forces were below strength and the fireships were scattered at various naval stations, some here and some there, on guard duty. The emperor therefore gathered together some hulks of the old fleet and strengthened them with new thwarts, added some transport vessels used in the imperial service, and got ready for sea a few triremes, on which he embarked a certain number of fighting men. After a generous supply of Greek fire had been put aboard these ships, he ranged them in the opposite harbour to face the Russian vessels. He himself, with a picked body of senators, spent the night at anchor in the actual harbour, not far from the shore. A clear declaration of war at sea was made to the barbarians by a herald, and when day broke The emperor set his fleet in battle array. The enemy also put to sea from the port on the other side. They sailed out as if they were leaving a military camp, complete with fortified rampart. When they were well out from the land, they arranged all their ships in line, so that they formed a continuous chain stretching across the water from the harbour on one side to the harbour on the other. They were now ready to attack us, or, if we made the first assault, to repel us. It was a sight that produced the most alarming effect on every man who saw it. For my own part, I was standing at the emperor’s side. He was seated on a hill which sloped gently down to the sea, watching the engagement from a distance. </p>
<p class='section-Chronographia'>Such then was the order of battle on their side and ours. No attempt was made to join combat, however, for each fleet remained motionless, with line intact. A considerable part of the day had already passed, when the emperor signalled two of our big ships to advance slowly on the enemy. They sailed forward line abreast, moving beautifully, with the pikemen and stone-throwers cheering aloft and the hurlers of Greek fire standing by in good order ready to shoot. At this, several of the Russian vessels left their line and bore down on our ships at full speed. Then, dividing in two, they circled round each of the triremes and hemmed them in, while they tried to hole them below deck with long poles. Our men, meanwhile, engaged them with stones from above and fought them off with their cutlasses. Greek fire, too, was hurled at them, and the Russians, being unable to see now, threw themselves into the water, trying to swim back to their comrades, or else, at a loss what to do, gave up all hope of escape. </p>
<p class='section-Chronographia'>Thereupon a second signal was given and more triremes put out to sea. Other ships followed or sailed alongside. It was our fleet now that took courage, while the enemy hove-to in amazement. When the triremes neared the barbarians, the latter lost all coherence and their line broke. Some had the fortitude to stay where they were but the majority fled. Suddenly the sun attracted a mist off the low lying land (most of the horizon consisted of high ground) and the weather changed. A strong breeze blew from east to west, ploughed up the sea with a hurricane, and rolled waves down on the Russians. Some of their ships were overwhelmed on the spot under the weight of tremendous seas; others were driven far away and hurled on to rocks and precipitous coasts. A certain number of these latter were hunted down by our triremes. Some they sank in deep water, with the crews still aboard. The fighting men in the triremes cut others in half and towed them, partially submerged, to nearby beaches. So a great massacre of barbarians took place and a veritable stream of blood reddened the sea: one might well believe it came down the rivers off the mainland.</p>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>Yaroslav’s son took a fleet down the river, and under cover of Vladimir attacking the palace walls in the Golden Horn I broke into the city, commandeered the cream of Greek shipbuilding, fucked Zoe one more time for old time’s sake, loaded all the gold from the Blachernae Palace onto the boat, and sailed away with the remnants of the Variangian Guard.</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>After passing the checkpoint at Kherson I raided a Pecheneg village and made them haul my boats upriver. </p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>That winter King Jarizleif married his daughter to Harald. Her name was Elizabeth, whom Northmen call Ellisif. Witness Stúf the Blind:</p>
<div class='poetry'>Kinship won the keen-eyed</div>
<div class='poetry'>king which he had wished,</div>
<div class='poetry'>gold a-plenty as guerdon</div>
<div class='poetry'>gained he, and eke the princess.</div>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>At Kiev I paid Yaroslav his share. I took my gold, his daughter, my friends, and all my boats, and headed north. </p>
