<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>Arctic noon dusk, on the beach of a calm fjord, two men recite poetry, call and refrain, over the still waters and beneath the looming mountains. I’ve come to Halogaland to fish for cod, to harvest the stickfish and the saltfish, to make skis and snow-shoes, to fashion mink cloaks and wollen sweaters, to fuck the local women and to watch the northern lights. Beside the mountain, beneath the sunset, under oars, a dark ship enters the fjord. The poetry ends and I wonder who it could be, on that boat, coming for me. </p>
<p class='section-Harald'>Wikipedia</p>
<p class='section-Harald'>Tostig appears to have governed in Northumbria with some difficulty. He was never popular with the Northumbrian ruling class, a mix of Danish invaders and Anglo-Saxon survivors of the last Norse invasion. Tostig was said to have been heavy-handed with those who resisted his rule, including murdering several members of leading Northumbrian families. In late 1063 or early 1064, Tostig had Gamal son of Orm and Ulf son of Dolfin assassinated when Gamal visited him under safe conduct. The <em>Vita </em><em>Edwardi</em>, otherwise sympathetic to Tostig, states that he had “repressed [the Northumbrians] with the heavy yoke of his rule”.</p>
<h2>Anglo Saxon Chronicle</h2>
<p class='section-Anglo Saxon Chronicle'>This was done on the mass-day of St. Bartholomew. Soon after this all the thanes in Yorkshire and in Northumberland gathered themselves together at York, and outlawed their Earl Tosty; slaying all the men of his clan that they could reach, both Danish and English; and took all his weapons in York, with gold and silver, and all his money that they could anywhere there find. </p>
<h2>Wikipedia</h2>
<p class='section-Wikipedia'>Harold Godwinson persuaded  to agree to the demands of the rebels. Tostig was outlawed a short time later, possibly early in November, because he refused to accept his deposition as commanded by Edward. This led to the fatal confrontation and enmity between the two Godwinsons. At a meeting of the king and his council, Tostig publicly accused Harold of fomenting the rebellion. Harold was keen to unify England in the face of the grave threat from , who had openly declared his intention to take the English throne. It was likely that Harold had exiled his brother to ensure peace and loyalty in the north. Tostig, however, remained unconvinced and plotted vengeance.</p>
<p class='section-Wikipedia'>Tostig took ship with his family and some loyal thegns and took refuge with his brother-in-law, Baldwin V, Count of Flanders. He even travelled to Normandy and attempted to form an alliance with William, who was related to his wife. Baldwin provided him with a fleet and he landed in the Isle of Wight in May 1066, where he collected money and provisions. He raided the coast as far as  but was forced to retreat when King Harold called out land and naval forces. He moved north and after an unsuccessful attempt to get his brother Gyrth to join him, he raided  and . The Earls Edwin and Morcar defeated him decisively. Deserted by his men, he fled to his sworn brother, King . Tostig spent the summer of 1066 in Scotland. </p>
<p class='section-Wikipedia'>He made contact with King  of Norway and persuaded him to invade England. One of the sagas claims that he sailed for Norway, and greatly impressed the Norwegian king and his court, managing to sway a decidedly unenthusiastic Hardrada, who had just concluded a long and inconclusive war with Denmark, into raising a levy to take the throne of England. </p>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>William of Normandy passes. Baldwin of Flanders passes, although he gives Tostig a few ships to make him go away. Malcom of Scotland passes. Harald of Norway, on the other hand, knows a good thing when he sees it. </p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Jarl Tósti changed direction in his travel, and turned up in Norway and went to see King Harald. He was in the Vík. And when they meet, the jarl reveals his errand to the king, telling him all about his travels since he left England and asking the king to give him support in getting back his realm in England. The king’s reply is this, that Norwegians would not be keen to travel to England and lay it waste and have an English ruler over them. </p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>“People say that those English are not very reliable.”</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Harald</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>His own brother Harold hated him so much that Harold kicked Tostig out of Essex and sent Tostig to York. The people in York hated Tostig so much they killed all Tostig’s housecarls and plundered all his gold. When their father died Harold disowned Tostig and kicked him out of Northumberland. Did I mention that Tostig has an incredibly punchable face?</p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>The jarl replies: “If you will not tell me, then I will tell you. King Magnús won Denmark because the leading men of that land helped him, and you did not get it because all the people of the country stood against you. King Magnús did not fight to conquer England because the people of the country wanted to have Eatvarðr as king. If you want to gain England, then I can bring it about that the majority of the leaders in England will be your friends and supporters. I lack nothing more in comparison with my brother Harold than just the name of king. Everyone knows that no such fighting man has been born in Northern Lands as you, and I find it surprising that you have been fighting for fifteen winters to win Denmark, but you will not take England, which now lies open to you.” </p>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>It could work. William would be invading from the south, I would be invading from the north, the English forces loyalty would be split between Harold, Tostig, and their home villages. It worked in Sicily. It worked for Cnut. Why couldn’t it work for me?</p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>King Harald considered carefully what the jarl was saying, and realised that much of what he said was true, and on the other hand he began to get keen to have the kingdom. After this the king and the jarl spoke together long and often. They settled on this plan, that they should in the summer go to England and conquer the country. King Harald sent word all over Norway and called out troops for an expedition, a half levy. This now became widely known. There were many guesses about where the expedition would be going. Some said, reckoning up King Harald’s achievements, that nothing would be impossible for him, while some said that England would be difficult to defeat, the population there being enormous.</p>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>They all tried to warn me. Gyrth tried to tell me.</p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Gyrth, who was stationed on the king’s ship, had a dream. It seemed to him that he was on the king’s ship and looked up on an island and there stood a big troll woman who had a sword in one hand and a trough in the other. And it seemed to him he looked over all their ships and that a bird sat on every prow. These were all eagles and ravens. The troll woman spoke this verse: </p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>That wot I well: enticed is</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>westward the king, to</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>fore-gather—my gain it is—with</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>glorious knuckles many.</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Keen-eyed carrion birds will</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>carve them plenteous tid-bits,</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>and famished ravens feast on</p>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>fallen—we’re leagued ever.</p>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>Thorth knew.</p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Thórth was on a ship not far from that of the king. One night he dreamed that he saw King Harald’s fleet come to land, and it seemed to him that land was England. On the land he saw an army in battle array, and it looked as though both parties prepared to do battle and had many banners aloft, and in front of the army of the inhabitants of that land a big troll woman rode on a wolf, and the wolf had the corpse of a man in his mouth, and blood dripping from his chops, and when he had eaten that man she tossed another one into his jaws, and so with one after another, and he swallowed them all. She spoke this verse</p>
<div class='poetry'>Red shield the troll shows as</div>
<div class='poetry'>shine forth swords for battle.</div>
<div class='poetry'>Seen is the dear lord’s downfall</div>
<div class='poetry'>dire by etin1 woman.</div>
<div class='poetry'>In wolf’s wide jaws she tosses</div>
<div class='poetry'>warriors’ bloody corpses;</div>
<div class='poetry'>ravening reddens his chops with</div>
<div class='poetry'>reeking gore of men slain,</div>
<div class='poetry'>the reeking gore of men slain.</div>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>I went back one last time to Voluspa in my pagan grove. </p>
<div class='poetry'>She had grown old,</div>
<div class='poetry'>As I had grown old,</div>
<div class='poetry'>The ash tree still stood,</div>
<div class='poetry'>As she foresaw my fate.</div>
<div class='poetry'></div>

<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>Even Olaf, bless his sainted soul, came into my dreams.</p>
<h2>Heimskringla</h2>
<p class='section-Heimskringla'>Still further, King Harald dreamed one night that he was in Nitharós and met King Óláf, his brother, and that he spoke a verse for him:</p>
<div class='poetry'>Honor earned him portly</div>
<div class='poetry'>atheling by his victories.</div>
<div class='poetry'>A holy death I had, on</div>
<div class='poetry'>homeland falling, glorious.</div>
<div class='poetry'>Fear I that, folk-ruler,</div>
<div class='poetry'>fey thou wilt be yonder,</div>
<div class='poetry'>gorging the greedy mount-of-</div>
<div class='poetry'>ghouls. ’Tis not God’s doing.</div>
<h2>Harald</h2>
<p class='section-Harald'>I knew that Tostig was full of shit. They all told me. Maybe I should have listened. But the Viking in me was too strong. I decided to do it anyway. I was fifty years old – how could I resist the chance for one more great adventure before I passed the kingdom down to my sons and retired to Halogaland to drink Rhenish wine and watch the northern lights.</p>
