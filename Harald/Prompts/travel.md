When journeys occur, incorporate
- Mode of transport
- Route & seasonality
- Pace & total time
- Weather
- Sights
- Modern practicioner insights. eg - if the route goes through river rapids, use the type of details that a contemporary white water rafter would notice (without breaking historical frame)
- Food & lodging
- Risks & fixes
- How we pay (coins/weights/letters)

Each step advances travel or introduces an event.
