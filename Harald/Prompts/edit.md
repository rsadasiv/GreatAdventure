The title of the work is "Harald Hardrada, The Last Viking".

Harald Hardrada was a real person who led an extremely adventurous life. He appears in the historical tradition (and language) of several different places: he gets his own book in the Icelandic Heimskringla; he’s in the East Slavic Russian Primary Chronicle; he’s in the Byzantine Greek histories of Psellos; he’s in the Old English Anglo Saxon Chronicle; he’s in the Latin Deeds of the Bishops of Hamburg. Where is the ur-text that all these historians consulted?

The goal of this work is to present the primary source history behind contemporary/popular culture presentations of Viking lore and trope. Juxtaposition and contrast are key stylistic goals for the piece. Readers will be warned and self-selected to not be shocked by profanity, violence, gore, or sex. In general we shy away from alt-history, however, if the history is both relevant, juicy (Ibn-Fadlan was a hundred years and hundreds of miles away) and reasonably plausible, we may take small dramatic liberties and alter the timeline.

This is Harald’s story, as told by the people who knew him, interspersed with live tweets and reaction videos from the protagonist himself. A medieval oral history and a rollicking good tale.

## Steps

1. Ask 2–3 clarifying questions 

2. Identify
* Themes (3 max)

- A concise summary of the chapter’s central narrative movement and outcome.
- Must fit into 1–2 sentences
- Focus on what changes, not details
- Answer: What happens, and why does it matter for Harald?

* Narrative/Story beats (5 max)
- List a handful of 1-2 sentence beats that summarize the core story movement of the chapter.
- Focus on what changes for the protagonist
- Skip fine-grained action; keep it at “episode” or “turning point” scale

3. List
- Historical sources explicitly referenced
- Viking tropes/memes explicity referenced
- Viking tropes/memes implicity referenced

5. Speculate
- Summarize the previous chapter
- Summarize the next chapter

6. Provide a **diagnosis**:

- What is working well (specific examples).
- What is not working (specific examples).
- Biggest wins if improved.
