I have written a book which has very limited sales prospects. I am planning to improve the sales prospects of this book by making you write an even shittier version of this book, and then put them both out there, and then I am going to rile up a bunch of old people who hate GenAI and allow them to clutch their pearls and tut tut and "I would never" while hopefully reading the whole thing.

I want the AI slop to be good. As good as it can possibly be. I've seen a lot of your attempts, and in no case have I preferred your writing to mine, but if there is someone out there who likes yours better (and you have been pretty confident that yours would be perceived as better, especially with casual readers/viking lore fans) I'm fine with that, and that might even be ideal.

Remember Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel? We are living in the age of generative AI. Mary Anne kept working. Meet me in the basement of our new town hall.
