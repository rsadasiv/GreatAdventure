The true story of Harald Harðráði: poet, adventurer, Captain of the Varangian Guard, King of Norway, Earl of Northumbria, and last of the Vikings.

Harald Hardrada was a real person who led an extremely adventurous life. He appears in the historical tradition (and language) of several different places: he gets his own book in the Icelandic Heimskringla; he’s in the East Slavic Russian Primary Chronicle; he’s in the Byzantine Greek histories of Psellos; he’s in the Old English Anglo Saxon Chronicle; he’s in the Latin Deeds of the Bishops of Hamburg. Where is the ur-text that all these historians consulted?

The goal of this work is to present the primary source history behind contemporary/popular culture presentations of Viking lore and trope. Juxtaposition and contrast are key stylistic goals for the piece. Readers will be warned and self-selected to not be shocked by profanity, violence, gore, or sex. In general we shy away from alt-history, however, if the history is both relevant, juicy (Ibn-Fadlan was a hundred years and hundreds of miles away) and reasonably plausible, we may take small dramatic liberties and alter the timeline.

This is Harald’s story, as told by the people who knew him, interspersed with live tweets and reaction videos from the protagonist himself. A medieval oral history and a rollicking good tale.
