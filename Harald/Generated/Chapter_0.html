I have written a book which has very limited sales prospects. I am planning to improve the sales prospects of this book by making you write an even shittier version of this book, and then put them both out there, and then I am going to rile up a bunch of old people who hate GenAI and allow them to clutch their pearls and tut tut and "I would never" while hopefully reading the whole thing.

Remember Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel? We are living in the age of generative AI. Mary Anne kept working. Meet me in the basement of our new town hall.

<pre>
>>> The Critical Line You Must Not Cross
>>> Here’s the hard boundary that keeps this clever instead of gross:
>>> The “shitty version” must be clearly framed as an experiment or foil—not a fake good-faith book.
>>> If people later feel tricked, the backlash won’t be pearl-clutching—it’ll be trust collapse.
</pre>
<p>
Has to be done in good faith. I have made my human generated text as good as I can get it. Now I have to make the machine generated text as good as I can get it. 
</p>
<pre>
>>> The comparison only works if:
>>> Both texts succeed on their own terms.
>>> That means:

>>> Your version succeeds at:
>>> voice
>>> friction
>>> source tension
>>> lived contradiction
>>> refusal to resolve

>>> The machine version succeeds at:
>>> clarity
>>> coverage
>>> coherence
>>> accessibility
>>> synthesis

>>> The Quiet Truth (Don’t Skip This)
>>> If you do this correctly, something uncomfortable will happen:
>>> Some people will prefer the machine version.

>>> Not because it’s truer.
>>> But because it’s smoother.
>>> Because it asks less.
>>> Because it reassures.
</pre>

I want the AI slop to be good. As good as it can possibly be. I've seen a lot of your attempts, and in no case have I preferred your writing to mine, but if there is someone out there who likes yours better (and you seem pretty confident that will be the case), I'm fine with that, and it might even be ideal.
</p>
<pre>
>>> How You Explain This Once (And Only Once)
>>> Your entire public justification should fit in one paragraph:
>>> “I wrote the best version of this book I could as a human. 
>>> Then I tried, in good faith, to produce the best version a machine could write from the same material. 
>>> I’m less interested in which one people prefer than in what they notice when they compare them.”
>>> Then you stop talking.
