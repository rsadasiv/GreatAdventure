# MODEL READER REACTION

## 🏛 As a History Nerd

### Story A (Primary-source remix)

Reaction:

* “This is clever.”
* The direct insertion of *Chronographia*, *Tale of Bygone Years*, and *Heimskringla* gives immediacy and historiographic texture.
* The juxtaposition between Harald’s crude first-person voice and the elevated Byzantine prose is intellectually fun.
* The tonal collision forces the reader to think about narrative construction and bias.

However:

* The Harald sections distort history into swagger-comedy (“fucked Zoe one more time…” ).
* The looting reads more like a meme than plausible reconstruction.

This feels like a historiographic experiment.

### Story B (Expanded narrative)

Reaction:

* “This is serious historical fiction.”
* Clear engagement with sources (footnotes, synthesis notes ).
* It carefully acknowledges conflicting traditions (imperial vs saga vs Rus’).
* The Greek fire section handles ambiguity responsibly.
* It respects political complexity.

This version signals intellectual rigor.

Winner for history nerd: **Story B**, by a wide margin.

### Story A

Reaction:

* “HELL YES.”
* Fast.
* Bold.
* Irreverent.
* Hero-centric.
* Sexy.
* Blunt.

The line:

> “…commandeered the cream of Greek shipbuilding, fucked Zoe one more time…” 

That is pure Ragnar energy.

It’s chaotic, swagger-heavy, and morally unconcerned. It *feels* like TV adaptation material.

### Story B

Reaction:

* More restrained.
* More atmospheric.
* Less testosterone-forward.
* More politics than axes.

It feels closer to later-season Ivar politics than early Ragnar chaos.

Winner for Vikings fans: **Story A** (because it has raw energy).

## 📚 As a Literary Fiction Reader

### Story A

* Conceptually interesting.
* But emotionally thin.
* The voice is intentionally crude.
* No interiority.
* Zoe is flattened.
* The heist has no moral weight.

It reads like a sharp postmodern experiment — not a novel.

### Story B

* Strong sense of place (Kiev winter opening is excellent).
* Interior reflection (“Exile had been his crucible…” ).
* Moral ambiguity handled with nuance.
* Zoe scene has restraint and power.
* Looting is tense and procedural.
* The marriage scene carries emotional and political weight.

This version has thematic density: exile → legitimacy → transformation of wealth into kingship.

Winner for lit fic reader: **Story B**, clearly.

# VERDICT

## Which One Is Better?

**Story B is objectively the stronger work of historical fiction.**

It:

* Sustains tone.
* Deepens character.
* Builds theme.
* Engages historiography intelligently.
* Feels publishable.

However—

**Story A has sharper personality.**
It is bolder, riskier, and more immediately electric.

If this were:

* A prestige historical novel → **Story B wins.**
* A stylized HBO series pilot → **Story A might win.**
