## ⚔️ As a Fan of *Vikings* (Netflix)

### Version A

**Reaction:**
“This is raw. This feels like saga energy.”

* First-person Harald voice (“So that’s where I died…”) is bold and cinematic.

* But the pacing is fractured.

**Emotional effect:**
High spikes of drama, but interrupted flow.

### Version B

**Reaction:**
“This is prestige drama.”

* Comet opening is atmospheric.
* Battle of Stamford Bridge is tense and brutal.

* Less flashy but more powerful.

**Emotional effect:**
Gravitas over swagger.

**Winner for Vikings fan:** Slight edge to Version A for stylistic boldness, but Version B wins for emotional payoff.

## 📚 As a Literary Fiction Reader

### Version A

**Reaction:**
“This feels conceptually interesting but structurally messy.”

* The documentary intercutting is intellectually interesting.
* But tonal shifts (Wikipedia → saga poetry → casual voice) fracture immersion.
* The “I’m still here” line is clever but destabilizing.

**Emotional effect:**
Meta-textual rather than immersive.

### Version B

**Reaction:**
“This is controlled, deliberate, and thematically coherent.”

* The comet as framing symbol.
* The concept of false hope.
* The narrowing of the Viking age.
* The meditation on inheritance and memory at the end.

**Emotional effect:**
Earned tragedy.

**Winner for lit fic reader:** Version B by a wide margin.

* Feels academic at moments.

**Emotional effect:**
Interesting but hard to follow.

### Version B

# 3️⃣ Diagnosis

---

# ✅ What Is Working Well

---

## Version A Strengths 

### 1. Bold Structural Concept

Intercutting primary sources creates:

* Multiplicity of perspective.
* Authentic medieval texture.
* A feeling of historiographical debate.

### 2. First-Person Harald Voice

Lines like:

> “So that’s where I died…”

Are arresting and memorable.

### 3. Raw Saga Energy

The Heimskringla battle passages have visceral force.
The bridge defender episode is especially strong.

---

## Version B Strengths 

### 1. Cohesion and Flow

The narrative moves with inevitability:

* Comet → mobilization → Fulford → false hope → Stamford → Hastings → burial.

No tonal whiplash.

### 2. Thematic Unity

Strong motifs:

* The comet.
* False hope.
* The narrowing of the Viking age.
* The idea of inheritance.

### 3. Mature Restraint

The prose trusts gravity:

* Harald’s death is not melodramatic.
* Hastings is contextualized, not sensationalized.
* Ending meditates on memory and legacy.

### 4. Strategic Emotional Control

The delay of tragedy heightens impact.
“Seven feet of earth” becomes symbolic.

# ❌ What Is Not Working

---

## Version A Weaknesses 

### 1. Wikipedia Sections Break Immersion

The modern voice feels sterile and out of place.

### 2. Tonal Inconsistency

* Chronicle prose → poetic saga → modern snark.
* No stable narrative authority.

### 3. Structural Fragmentation

Reads like research notes rather than a finished novel chapter.

### 4. Emotional Arc Is Blunted

Because perspective keeps shifting, tragedy never fully settles.

---

## Version B Weaknesses 

### 1. Slightly Safe

It avoids stylistic risk.
No experimental structure.

### 2. Less Authorial Personality

Compared to Version A’s bold “Harald” voice.

### 3. Some Sections Are Reportorial

Occasional passages feel summarizing rather than dramatized.
