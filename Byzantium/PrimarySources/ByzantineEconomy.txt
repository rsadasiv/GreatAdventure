Some commentators have suggested that “structural imbalance” is a euphemism for “deficit.” It is not. It is the difference between government revenues and spending.
The Byzantine Empire in the Age of Justinian had what the World Bank would delicately describe as a “structural budget imbalance”. Revenues were strong, the Anatolians in particular were good earners, and there was room for additional revenue growth from military conquests and ennoblements. However, spending was high, and any reduction in spending had political consequences. You can’t scrimp on bread and circuses (you would not believe how much it costs to run a chariot race in this town) or else you have a mob in the capital anointing your replacement (Nika). You can’t scrimp on the bureaucracy or else you might have some civil servant slandering you in the media (Secret History). You can’t scrimp on the standing army, or else you have your replacement marching into the capital (Maurice). Like a Barcelona socio you might be tempted to “pull certain financial levers” (sale of Exarch), but then you have your replacement sailing in from Carthage (Heraclius). You can’t scrimp on the mercenaries, because the standing army certainly can’t defend the borders. With a monopoly on coinage you could execute certain “quantitative easing” maneuvers, but that only helped gold capital, not ongoing tax revenue.
