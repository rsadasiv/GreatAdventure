iam pridem, ex quo suffragia nulli
vendimus, effudit curas; nam qui dabat olim
imperium, fasces, legiones, omnia, nunc se 
continet atque duas tantum res anxius optat,
panem et circenses.

Already long ago, from when we sold our vote to no man, 
the People have abdicated our duties; 
for the People who once upon a time handed out military command, 
high civil office, legions — everything, 
now restrains itself and anxiously hopes for just two things: 
bread and circuses.
