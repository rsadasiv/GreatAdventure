We are in Kashgar, a Silk Road village nestled in the crotch of the Pamirs, the Hindu Kush, and the Taklamakan desert. Maryam and her son Rostam are in a small bedroom, snuggling under fur blankets and speaking together, quietly, in Byzantine Greek.

Rostam:
Mama, how did we get here?

Maryam: 
We came over the mountains to the west. There was a Turkish herdsman to guide us and a yak for cartage, but I carried you on my back, and you cried the whole way. It was so cold, so cold, but having come over the pass I knew that our enemies could not follow us and that we would be safe here.

Rostam:
No mama, from the beginning. When I was a little girl…

Maryam:
That was a long time ago, and a long way from here. Aren’t you tired?

Rostam:
From the beginning. When I was a little girl...

Maryam:
When I was a little girl I lived on an island in the middle of the sea. We called it Dēmónēsoi. So much water – from the narrow end, to the east, there was nothing but water, as far as you could see. The sea is salty, like Issykul, but not bitter, almost sweet. Waves lapped at the shore and the smell of the air was … soft and alive. From the wide end, to the west, you could tell that we were not so far from land. There were hills, not like the mountains here, but steeply rising out of the water, and covered in green trees. And to the north there were boats and sails, and in the distance, the graceful dome of the Hagia Sophia and the city of Byzantium. My favorite thing was to go to the beach, collect shells and stones and arrange them in the sand, and imagine what my life could become.

Rostam:
	Were you alone? Where was your mama?

Maryam:
	I don’t remember my mama. The closest memory I have is a feeling of love, unconditional love, but I can’t see her face, I just know that she was there. I wasn’t alone growing up, there were many other children, most around my age. It was kind of an orphanage for unwanted children of the court, not so dangerous that we needed to be killed, but not so innocent that we could be free. There was a dormitory where we slept, with beds and a fireplace, a cookhouse where we ate our meals, and a church for mass and instruction. There were nuns to teach us and priests to beat us; cooks to feed us and shepherds to make sure that the goats and the sheep that we slept with did not wander off a cliff and fall into the water.

Rostam:
	We are not on an island. How did you leave the island?

Maryam:
	We weren’t always on the island. On special occasions: Easter, Christmas, someone’s birthday, a boat would come and take us to the city, and we would be escorted to the cathedral for mass, to the Hippodrome for chariot races, or perhaps to the palace for a feast. But at the end of it we were always taken back to the island. When I left the island for good I was … seventeen? A boat came from the city but I was the only one taken aboard. They brought me to the city, to a room high up in the palace, with candlesticks and a fire, and a lady of the court came to my room and told me that I had been selected, above all other girls, for a special mission, to serve God and the emperor and the country which had birthed me and owned me and kept me alive. I was to go to the east, to begin a life of the utmost importance, to marry a king, 

Rostam:
	Was that my papa?

Maryam:
	Varkhuman is a good man, and you must honor him as sons honor fathers. To name your true father, to claim your birthright, aloud, is too dangerous, even here, beyond the mountains and the desert, far from Ctesiphon and where you were born. Look where Orion is in the sky. It is very late my love, aren’t you tired?

Rostam:
	No mama. How did you meet my papa? From the beginning, when I was a girl…

Maryam:
	I wasn’t a girl. A woman I guess? I didn’t really know what that meant but I had outgrown my childish shape. They kept me in the castle for months, and each day they would teach me things: the ways of a princess; how to dress in beautiful clothes, to adorn myself with creams and powders and combs and emollients; how to speak to a priest in the language of the church, to kneel and to pray, to cast my eyes down and to look people in the eye; to know what was important to the empire and what was important to a man and how to get my way.
	Once a week a horrible old man, Procopius, would come to me. I was quite afraid of him, although he never touched me or beat me. He would always start with the sins of my grandmother Theodora; how she ruined an emperor, how she ruined an empire, how she lied and cheated and turned on her friends, how she performed the most despicable acts, how her soul was depraved and how the sins that she committed were so heinous that even two generations later it was still a blot on my soul that I must expiate by going to Persia, by keeping the faith, by carrying out any instructions from the emperor and by bearing and raising a Christian heir to the Sassanian throne.
	So many things they tried to teach me about how to woo Khosrow and how to conquer Eranshahr … but not a word of Persian.

Maryam looks down at her lap where Rostam, lips open, is quietly snoring. She puts him down gently on the bedding, covers him up, puts out the fire, and prepares to leave the room. At the doorway she looks back and says “Sleep well my prince. Perhaps someday you will have to answer the prompt ‘When I was a boy…’”
