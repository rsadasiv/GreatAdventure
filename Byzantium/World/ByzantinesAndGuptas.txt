In this city the ruler's wives have carriages made of gold, each of which is drawn by one bullock lavishly decorated with gold and precious stones; and even the oxen's reins are gold-inlaid. 
And so the man who has assumed the crown used to pass the night with seven hundred women. The wives of the nobility used silver carriages. There is a report that Alexander also founded another city a few miles away, which the barbarians name Chubdan; 
and that when the leader dies, he is mourned for ever by his wives, who have their heads shaved and who wear black clothing; and that it is the custom for these women never to leave the tomb. Chubdan is divided by two great rivers, whose banks nod, so to speak, with cypresses. 
The nation has many elephants. They associate in trade with the Indians, and they say that these Indians who face the northern regions are actually born white. 
The worms, from which come the Seric threads, are possessed by the said nation in very great numbers and are in turn possessed of varied colour; the barbarians eagerly practise the husbandry of the said creatures.
